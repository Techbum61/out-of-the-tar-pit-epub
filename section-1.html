    <h2 class="calibre1">1 Introduction</h2>
    <p class="calibre1">The “software crisis” was first identified in 1968
    [<a href="index_split_000.html#dummy" class="calibre2">NR69</a>] and in the
    intervening decades has deepened rather than abated. The biggest problem in
    the development and maintenance of large-scale software systems is
    complexity — large systems are hard to understand. We believe that the major
    contributor to this complexity in many systems is the handling of state and
    the burden that this adds when trying to analyse and reason about the
    system. Other closely related contributors are code volume, and explicit
    concern with the flow of control through the system.</p>
    <p class="calibre1">The classical ways to approach the difficulty of state
    include object-oriented programming which tightly couples state together
    with related behaviour, and functional programming which — in its pure form
    — eschews state and side-effects all together. These approaches each suffer
    from various (and differing) problems when applied to traditional
    large-scale systems.</p>
    <p class="calibre1">We argue that it is possible to take useful ideas from
    both and that — when combined with some ideas from the relational database
    world — this approach offers significant potential for simplifying the
    construction of large-scale software systems.</p>
    <p class="calibre1">The paper is divided into two halves. In the first half
    we focus on complexity. In <a href="section-2.html"
    class="calibre2">section 2</a> we look at complexity in general and justify
    our assertion that it is at the root of the crisis, then we look at how we
    currently attempt to understand systems
    in <a href="section-3.html" class="calibre2">section 3</a>.
    In <a href="index_split_000.html#section4" class="calibre2">section
    4</a> we look at the causes of complexity (i.e. things which make
    understanding difficult) before discussing the classical approaches to
    managing these complexity causes in <a href="index_split_000.html#section5"
    class="calibre2">section 5</a>. In <a href="index_split_000.html#section6"
    class="calibre2">section 6</a> we define what we mean by “accidental” and
    “essential” and then in <a href="index_split_000.html#section7"
    class="calibre2">section 7</a> we give recommendations for alternative ways
    of addressing the causes of complexity — with an emphasis on avoidance of
    the problems rather than coping with them.</p>
    <p class="calibre1">In the second half of the paper we consider in more
    detail a possible approach that follows our recommended strategy. We start
    with a review of the relational model
    in <a href="index_split_000.html#section8" class="calibre2">section 8</a> and
    give an overview of the potential approach
    in <a href="index_split_000.html#section9" class="calibre2">section
    9</a>. In <a href="index_split_000.html#section10" class="calibre2">section
    10</a> we give a brief example of how the approach might be used.</p>
    <p class="calibre1">Finally we contrast our approach with others
    in <a href="index_split_000.html#section11" class="calibre2">section 11</a> and
    then give conclusions in <a href="index_split_000.html#section12"
    class="calibre2">section 12</a>.</p>
