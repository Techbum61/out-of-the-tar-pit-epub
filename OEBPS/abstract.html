    <h2 class="calibre1">Abstract</h2>
    <p class="calibre1">Complexity is the single major difficulty in the
    successful development of large-scale software systems. Following Brooks we
    distinguish accidental from essential difficulty, but disagree with his
    premise that most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is
    essential. We identify common causes of complexity and discuss general
    approaches which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in
    nature. To make things more concrete we then give an outline for a potential
    complexity-minimizing approach based on functional programming and Coddâ€™s
    relational model of data.</p>
